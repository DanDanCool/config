Completion:
https://github.com/nvim-lua/completion-nvim
Note: will probably not work with snippets, only gets completion items from lsp. This is a cut down version of the plugin.

Treesitter:
https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter
Note: this only provides highlighting functionality, everything else was cut. In addition, this does not support the 'is?' predicate
